Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below.
Index 0 will be considered even. For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.
The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

I tried it for 20 mintues until I looked for someone elses approach and modified the approach by using similar methods to achieve the same lines
